Our Service might let you zap certain info about yourself right from within the Service itself. Pow! 💥

You can always log into your account (if you've got one) and hit up the account settings section that lets you manage your personal info to update, change, or wipe your info. You can also totally get in touch with us to ask for access, correction, or deletion of any Personal Information you've handed over to us.

But do remember, we might need to hang onto certain info when we've got a legal obligation or a legitimate basis for it.

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

If the Company gets involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data might get shuffled around. We'll give you a heads-up before your Personal Data is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.

#### Law Enforcement
In certain situations, the Company might have to spill your Personal Data if the law says so or in response to valid requests by public authorities (like a court or government agency).

- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing related to the Service
- Shield the personal safety of Service users or the public
- Guard against legal liability

### Security of Your Personal Data
The security of your Personal Data is a big deal to us, but keep in mind that no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is ever 100% foolproof. While we totally bust our chops to use commercially acceptable ways to shield your Personal Data, we just can't guarantee its absolute security. It's a tricky world out there! 🔒

## Children's Privacy
Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under the age of 13. We don't knowingly scoop up personally identifiable info from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you're aware your kiddo has handed over Personal Data to us, please hit us up. If we find out we've collected Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verifying parental consent, we'll totally take steps to delete that info from our servers. Kids' privacy is serious business! 👶

If we need to rely on consent as the legal basis for processing your info, and your country requires parental consent, we might ask for your parent's consent before we collect and use that info.

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might contain links to other websites that aren't run by us. If you click on a third-party link, you'll get redirected to that third-party's site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every single site you visit. Better safe than sorry! 🔗

We have zero control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. Just sayin'! 🤷‍♀️

---

This Privacy Policy outlines our approach to collecting, utilizing, and disclosing your information when you engage with our Service, clarifying your privacy rights and the legal protections available to you.

We leverage your personal data to provide and continuously improve our Service. By using the Service, you're giving us the green light to collect and use your info just as we've laid out in this Privacy Policy.

## Interpretations and Definitions

### Interpretations
Capitalized words, whether singular or plural, have meanings defined under the following conditions.

### Definitions
For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, here's what certain terms mean:

- **Account** means that special unique account we set up for you to hop into our Service or certain parts of it.

- **Affiliate** is basically any entity that's got a controlling stake in, is controlled by, or shares common control with another party. By "control," we're talking about owning 50% or more of the shares, equity, or voting securities for folks like directors or other management.

- **Company** (you'll see us refer to ourselves as "the Company," "We," "Us," or "Our" in this Agreement) is, you guessed it, **hubtoday**.

- **Cookies** are those tiny files websites stash on your computer, mobile, or any other gadget. They're packed with details like your browsing history on that site, serving all sorts of purposes.

- **Country** is a simple one: California, United States.

- **Device** just means anything you use to hop onto our Service – think computers, phones, or even your trusty digital tablet.

- **Personal Data** is basically any info that can be tied back to you, a specific identified or identifiable person.

- **Service** is just a fancy word for this Website.

- **Service Provider** refers to any individual or company (aka "natural or legal person") who crunches data for us. These are the third-party pros we bring in to help us out: delivering the Service, doing Service-related tasks, or giving us insights into how you're using it.

- **Usage Data** is the info we automatically collect – it's generated either by you using the Service or from the Service's own systems (like how long you hung out on a particular page).

- **Website** is **hubtoday**, which you can find right here: `https://ai.hubtoday.app/`.

- **You** refers to the person using or checking out our Service, or if you're doing it for a business or legal entity, then that entity.

## Collecting and Using Your Personal Data

### Types of Data Collected

#### Personal Data
When you're using our Service, we might just ask you for some personally identifiable info. This is the stuff we could use to get in touch or figure out who you are. This personal info *might* include (but isn't strictly limited to):

- Email address
- Usage Data

#### Usage Data
Usage Data? That's the stuff that gets automatically collected whenever you're using the Service.

This Usage Data might include goodies like your Device's Internet Protocol address (yeah, your IP address), what browser you're rocking and its version, which pages you checked out on our Service, when you popped in and for how long, your unique device ID, and other techy diagnostic info.

If you're hitting up the Service on your mobile device, we might automatically snag some info. This could be anything from the type of mobile device you're using, its unique ID, its IP address, your mobile OS, the kind of mobile browser you prefer, and yep, those unique device identifiers and other diagnostic bits.

Also, whether you're on a desktop or mobile, we might collect info your browser sends our way whenever you visit our Service.

### Tracking Technologies and Cookies
We're big on using Cookies and similar tracking tech to keep tabs on activity on our Service and squirrel away some info. These tracking tools include things like beacons, tags, and scripts – all designed to gather and track data, helping us polish and analyze our Service. So, the tech we use might include:

- 🍪 **Cookies (or Browser Cookies, as some call 'em):** These are tiny files a website tucks onto your device. You've got the power to tell your browser to reject all Cookies or give you a heads-up when one's trying to come through. But heads up: if you don't play nice with Cookies, some parts of our Service might not work for you. Unless you've specifically told your browser to say "nope" to Cookies, our Service will likely be using them.
- 📡 **Web Beacons:** You might spot these tiny electronic files (also known as clear GIFs, pixel tags, or single-pixel GIFs) hiding in some parts of our Service or our emails. They basically let us do cool things like count how many folks have checked out a page or opened an email. They're also super handy for other website stats, like seeing which sections are booming or making sure our systems and servers are running smoothly.

Cookies can be either "Persistent" or "Session" types. Persistent ones stick around on your computer or mobile even after you've logged off, but Session Cookies? They vanish the moment you close your browser. Poof!

We actually use both Session and Persistent Cookies, and here's why:

- 🛠️ **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
  - **Type**: Session Cookies
  - **Managed by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These are the unsung heroes! They're absolutely crucial for delivering the services you expect from our Website and letting you use its key features. Think of them as the bouncers that verify who you are and keep those pesky fraudulent accounts out. Without these, we just couldn't provide the services you're after – plain and simple. We only use 'em for this essential job.

- ✅ **Cookies Policy / Acceptance Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Managed by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These clever Cookies just remember if you've already given us the thumbs-up to use Cookies on the Website. One less thing for you to click!

- ✨ **Functionality Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Managed by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These are all about making your life easier! They let us recall your choices when you're hanging out on the Website – things like your login info or your preferred language. The big idea? To give you a super personalized experience so you don't have to punch in your preferences every single time you visit. Sweet!

### Use of Your Personal Data
So, the Company might use Personal Data for a few key reasons:

- 🚀 **To provide and maintain our Service:** This covers everything from keeping our Service up and running to keeping an eye on how you're using it.
- 🔑 **To manage Your Account:** This means taking care of your registration as a Service user. The Personal Data you share helps you unlock and access all those cool features available only to registered users.
- 🤝 **For the performance of a contract:** This means we'll use your data to get those purchase contracts (for any products, items, or services you buy) all set up, followed through, and completed. Or, any other contracts you might have with us via the Service, for that matter!
- 📞 **To contact You:** We might ping you via email, phone call, SMS, or other digital means (like push notifications from our mobile app). This is usually for updates or important info about features, products, or services you've signed up for – including those crucial security updates – whenever it's necessary or makes good sense.
- 📣 **To provide You with news:** We'll send you news, awesome special offers, and general info about other cool stuff, services, and events we're offering. These will be similar to what you've already bought or shown interest in, unless, of course, you tell us to hold off.
- 📨 **To manage Your requests:** This means we'll jump on and handle any requests you send our way.
- 💼 **For business transfers:** If we're ever looking at a merger, sale, restructuring, or any kind of asset transfer (whether we're still operating or in, say, bankruptcy), we might use your info to make that happen. In these scenarios, your Personal Data, which we hold about our Service users, could be one of the assets changing hands.
- 🤔 **For other purposes:** We might also use your info for other stuff, like digging into data (hello, analytics!), spotting usage trends, figuring out if our promo campaigns are hitting the mark, and generally sprucing up our Service, products, marketing, and your overall experience.

We might share your personal info in a few specific situations:

- 🤝 **With Service Providers:** We might share your personal info with our Service Providers. They help us keep an eye on how our Service is being used, analyze it, and sometimes even get in touch with you on our behalf.
- 💼 **For business transfers:** Should we ever undergo a merger, sell off company assets, secure financing, or get acquired (fully or partially) by another company, your personal info might be shared or transferred during those negotiations or the process itself.
- 👯‍♀️ **With Affiliates:** We might share your info with our affiliated companies. Don't worry, we'll make sure they play by the rules of this Privacy Policy too! Affiliates cover our parent company, any sister subsidiaries, joint venture pals, or any other companies we control or share control with.
- 🤝 **With business partners:** We might team up with our business partners and share your info to bring you certain products, services, or awesome promotions.
- 🗣️ **With other users:** If you're sharing personal info or interacting in public areas of our Service with other users, just a heads-up: that info could be seen by *everyone* and potentially even shared publicly outside the Service.
- 👍 **With Your consent:** And hey, if you give us the nod, we might disclose your personal info for any other reason you agree to.

### Retention of Your Personal Data
The Company will only hold onto your Personal Data for as long as we absolutely need it for the purposes mentioned in this Privacy Policy. We'll also keep and use your Personal Data as much as required to meet our legal duties (like when laws say we *have* to keep certain data), sort out any disagreements, and make sure our legal agreements and policies are followed.

We'll also hang onto Usage Data for our internal analytical deep dives. Generally, Usage Data sticks around for a shorter stint, *unless* we're using it to beef up our Service's security, boost its features, or if we're legally required to keep it for longer.

### Transfer of Your Personal Data
Your info (yep, including your Personal Data) gets processed right here at the Company's offices, plus any other spots where the folks involved in processing it are located. This means your info might get shuttled over to — and stored on — computers *outside* your state, province, country, or even governmental jurisdiction. Just a heads-up that data protection laws in those places might be a bit different from what you're used to.

By giving a thumbs-up to this Privacy Policy and then submitting your info, you're essentially agreeing to this transfer.

The Company is committed to taking *all* reasonable steps to make sure your data is handled securely and totally in line with this Privacy Policy. We won't transfer your Personal Data to any organization or country unless we're confident there are solid controls in place, including robust security for all your data and personal info.

### Delete Your Personal Data
Good news! You've got the right to delete, or ask us to help you delete, the Personal Data we've collected about you.

Our Service might even let you zap some of your info right from inside the Service itself. Pretty neat, huh?

You're free to update, tweak, or outright delete your info anytime! Just log into your Account (if you've got one) and hit up the account settings where you can manage your personal info. Or, if you prefer, you can just give us a shout and ask to access, correct, or delete any personal info you've given us.

Just a quick note though: we might need to hang onto certain info if we're legally obligated or have a solid lawful reason to do so.

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
📈 **Business Transactions:** If the Company ever gets into a merger, acquisition, or sells off assets, your Personal Data might get transferred. We promise to give you a heads-up before your Personal Data moves and falls under a different Privacy Policy.

#### Law Enforcement
👮‍♀️ **Law Enforcement:** Sometimes, if the law demands it or if public authorities (like a court or government agency) make a valid request, the Company might have to spill the beans and disclose your Personal Data.

#### Other Legal Requirements
⚖️ **Other Legal Requirements:** The Company might also disclose your Personal Data if we honestly believe it's necessary to:
- Comply with a legal obligation
- Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
- Protect the personal safety of Users of the Service or the public
- Protect against legal liability

### Security of Your Personal Data
🔒 **Security of Your Personal Data:** The safety of your Personal Data is a big deal to us, no doubt! But keep in mind, there's no silver bullet for online data transmission or electronic storage – nothing is *ever* 100% foolproof. While we bust our butts to use top-notch, commercially acceptable methods to shield your Personal Data, we just can't give a rock-solid guarantee of its absolute security.

## Children's Privacy
👶 **Children's Privacy:** Our Service isn't for anyone under 13 – period. We absolutely do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable info from kids under that age. If you're a parent or guardian and realize your little one has given us Personal Data, please hit us up ASAP! If we ever find out we've collected Personal Data from someone under 13 without verifiable parental consent, you bet we'll swiftly scrub that info from our servers.

Also, if we need to get your "OK" to process your info (and your country requires a parent's OK for minors), we might just ask for your parent's consent before we gather and use that information.

## Links to Other Websites
🔗 **Links to Other Websites:** Our Service might have links to other websites that we don't operate. If you click on one of those third-party links, you'll be whisked away to *their* site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every single site you visit!

Just so we're clear: we've got zero control over, and take zero responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of *any* third-party sites or services out there.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
🔄 **Changes to This Privacy Policy:** We might update our Privacy Policy every now and then. When we do, we'll let you know by simply posting the fresh new version right here on this page.

Before any big changes kick in, we'll make sure to give you a heads-up through email and/or a prominent notice right on our Service. We'll also update that "Last updated" date at the very top of this Privacy Policy.

It's a good idea to peek at this Privacy Policy periodically to catch any tweaks. Generally, any changes become effective the moment they're posted right here.

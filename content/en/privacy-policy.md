### Retention of Your Personal Data
The Company will only hold onto your Personal Data for as long as it's needed for the purposes laid out in this Privacy Policy. We'll keep and use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to follow our legal obligations (like if we need to hold your data to comply with applicable laws), duke out disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

The Company will also hang onto Usage Data for internal analysis. Usage Data usually gets a shorter shelf life unless it's used to amp up the security or improve the functionality of our service, or if we're legally obliged to keep it longer.

### Transfer of Your Personal Data
Your info (including Personal Data) gets processed at the Company's operating offices and any other spots where the parties involved in the processing are located. This means this info could be zipped over to and stored on computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where data protection laws might differ from yours.

By agreeing to this Privacy Policy and submitting such info, you're giving a big nod to that transfer.

The Company will take all reasonably necessary steps to make sure your data is handled securely and in line with this Privacy Policy. No dice on transferring your Personal Data to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place, including the security of your data and other personal info.

### Delete Your Personal Data
You've got the right to delete or ask us for a hand in deleting the Personal Data we've collected about you.

Our service might let you zap certain info about yourself right from within the service.

You can totally update, modify, or delete your info at any time by logging into your account (if you've got one) and hitting up the account settings section that lets you manage your personal info. You can also give us a shout to request access to, correct, or delete any personal info you've tossed our way.

But please note: we might need to hang onto certain info when we have a legal obligation or a lawful basis to do so.

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company gets involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data might be transferred. We'll give you a heads-up before your Personal Data gets moved and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.

#### Law enforcement
Under certain circumstances, the Company might be forced to spill your Personal Data if required by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (like a court or government agency).

#### Other legal requirements
The Company might dish out your Personal Data, genuinely believing such action is necessary to:
- Comply with a legal obligation
- Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
- Protect the personal safety of Users of the Service or the public
- Protect against legal liability

### Security of Your Personal Data
The security of Your Personal Data is a big deal to us, but keep in mind that no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is ever 100% bulletproof. While we go all out to use commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, we can't promise its absolute security. 🤷‍♀️

## Children's Privacy

Our Service doesn't target anyone under the age of 13. We don't knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you're hip to the fact that your child has given us Personal Data, please hit us up. If we find out we've collected Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verifying parental consent, we'll take steps to ditch that info from our servers.

If we need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your info and your country requires a parent's consent, we might ask for your parent's permission before we collect and use that info.

## Links to Other Websites

Our Service might be rocking links to other websites that we don't operate. If you click on a third-party link, you'll be whisked away to that third party's site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.

We have zero control over, and assume zero responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

We might update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We'll give you a heads-up about any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

Before the changes kick in, we'll give you a shout via email and/or a prominent notice on our service, and update the "Last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.

You're advised to periodically check this Privacy Policy for any updates. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they're posted on this page.

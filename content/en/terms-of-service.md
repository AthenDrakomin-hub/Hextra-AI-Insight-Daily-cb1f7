# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (we'll just call it "the Site" or "we" from here on out). Before you dive into all the cool stuff we offer, please give these Terms of Service a good read. By cruising around or using our Site, you're totally agreeing to and accepting these terms. Awesome! ✨

## 1. Service Overview
The Site hooks users up with paid subscription content and membership services. Think blog posts, exclusive goodies, e-books, and lively community chats, to name a few. Just a heads up, some of the primo content is only for our subscribed members! 🚀

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
*   To get started, users need to provide a valid email and set up a password for their account.
*   Heads up, users are totally responsible for their account's security and everything that happens under it. Seriously, **no transferring or sharing accounts** – that's a big no-no! 🙅‍♀️
*   If a user ever breaks these terms, the Site totally reserves the right to **suspend or even terminate** their account. Just sayin'.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
*   Subscription services are billed monthly or annually, and you'll see all the costs crystal clear on the checkout page. No surprises! 💸
*   All your payments cruise through trusted third-party platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Don't sweat it, the Site doesn't store any of your payment info directly. Phew!
*   Your subscription will **automatically renew**, so you'll stay in the loop unless you hit that cancel button before your current billing cycle wraps up. Easy peasy.
*   **Our Sweet 14-Day Refund Policy**: First-time subscribers, if you're just not feeling the love within 14 days of purchase, you can totally snag a full refund. Just shoot us an email (find it at the end of these terms) and tell us what's up. Each user gets one shot at this awesome refund. After 14 days, or if you've subscribed before, then it's generally **no refunds** unless the law says otherwise. Fair is fair! 👍

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
*   FYI, all our original content is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. That means no copying, reprinting, or using it for commercial stuff without our say-so. We work hard on it! 😉
*   Users get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right**, strictly for your personal learning and reading pleasure. Keep it to yourself!
*   Wanna use something for commercial purposes or quote us a bunch? Just hit up the Site to get our authorization. We're usually pretty cool about it!

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
*   Listen up! Users are **strictly prohibited** from uploading, posting, or spreading any content that's illegal, harassing, fake, offensive, or steps on anyone else's rights. Let's keep it friendly, folks! 🚫
*   Also, **don't even think about** mass downloading, scraping, or trying to crack our member content with any techy tricks. That's a definite no-go.
*   The Site has every right to yank any inappropriate content and **ban users who break the rules**. Seriously, play nice!

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
*   Just so you know, we totally reserve the right to change, pause, or even stop parts or all of our services at any time, without giving you a heads-up. That's just how the tech world rolls sometimes! 🤷‍♀️
*   If, for some wild reason like an act of nature, server hiccup, or a third-party service outage, our content goes poof temporarily, the Site **won't be on the hook** for any compensation. Bummer, but true.

## 7. Disclaimer
*   Heads up! The info we dish out on the Site is purely for reference. It's **not** professional advice for anything like finances, legal stuff, or even medical woes. Always check with a pro! 🧑‍🔬
*   And just to be super clear, the Site **isn't responsible** for any direct or indirect losses you might rack up from using our content or services. Use at your own risk, folks!

## 8. Governing Law
*   These Terms of Service are like, totally under the laws of California, USA, and we'll interpret them that way, no matter what other law principles might say. West Coast rules! 🌴
*   Got a beef or a dispute related to these terms? Let's try to chat it out nicely first. If that doesn't work, then you're agreeing to take it to the courts in Santa Clara County, California. Game on!

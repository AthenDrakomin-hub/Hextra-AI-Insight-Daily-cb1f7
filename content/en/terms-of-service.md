# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (which we'll call the "Site" or "we" from now on). Before you dive into using our services, please take a moment to read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using the Site, you're giving us a nod of agreement to these terms.

## 1. About Our Services
The Site offers users awesome paid subscription content and member services. This includes, but isn't limited to, blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interaction. Just a heads-up: some content is only accessible to our awesome subscribers.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
*   Users need to provide a valid email address and set a password to register for an account.
*   Users are responsible for the security of their account and all activities that happen under it. Seriously, **no transferring or sharing** your account!
*   The Site has the right to **suspend or terminate** a user's account if they breach these terms. Just sayin'.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
*   Subscription services are billed on a monthly/annual basis, with fees clearly stated on the checkout page.
*   All payments are processed through third-party payment platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). FYI, we don't store your payment info here.
*   Subscriptions will **automatically renew** unless you cancel before the end of your current billing cycle. Don't forget! 😉
*   Our **14-day refund policy** states that first-time subscribers can request a full refund within 14 days of purchase if they're not happy with the service. Just shoot us an email at the contact address provided at the end of these terms and tell us why. Each user gets one shot at this refund. After 14 days, or for non-first-time subscribers, payments are **non-refundable** unless legally required. No exceptions! 🚫

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
*   All original content is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. Please don't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without authorization. That's a big no-no! 🙅‍♀️
*   Users only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access** our content for personal study and reading. Keep it personal, folks!
*   For commercial use or extensive quotation, please contact the Site to get authorization. Let's chat first! 🤝

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
*   It's strictly **forbidden** to upload, post, or spread any content that is illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on others' rights. Play nice, people! 🙏
*   It's also **forbidden** to mass download, crawl, or crack member content using technical means. Seriously, don't even try. 🕵️‍♂️
*   The Site has the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban violating users**. We're not messing around!

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
*   We reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate some or all services at any time, without prior notice. Just a heads-up!
*   The Site **will not be liable for compensation** if content is temporarily inaccessible due to force majeure, server failures, or third-party service interruptions. Sometimes things just happen, ya know? 🤷‍♀️

## 7. Disclaimer
*   The information provided by the Site is for reference only and **does not constitute** any professional advice (e.g., financial, legal, medical, etc.). We're not pros in those fields! 🤓
*   The Site **will not be responsible** for any direct or indirect losses incurred by users due to their use of the Site's content or services. Use at your own risk! 😉

## 8. Governing Law
*   These Terms of Service are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
*   For any disputes arising from or related to these terms, both parties should first try to resolve them through friendly negotiation. If that doesn't work out, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts in Santa Clara County, California. Let's keep it civil, folks! ✌️

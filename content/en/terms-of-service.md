# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (which we'll refer to as "the Site" or "we"). Before you dive into using our services, please take a moment to carefully read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using our Site, you're essentially giving us a thumbs-up and agreeing to these terms.

## 1. What We Offer
Our services? Well, **ai.hubtoday** is all about providing users with paid subscription content and exclusive membership perks. This includes, but isn't limited to, blog posts, special resources, eBooks, and community vibes. Just a heads-up, some of our juiciest content is only for our subscribed members! 😉

## 2. Your Account & Registration
To get started, **users** need to register an account by providing a valid email address and setting up a password. Your account is super important, so you're responsible for its security and all activities under it. Seriously, **no sharing or transferring** your account – that's a big no-no! If you break these rules, **the Site** has the right to either **pause or completely terminate** your account. Keep it locked down! 🔒

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
**Our subscription services** operate on a monthly or annual billing cycle, and don't worry, all the fees are clearly laid out on the checkout page. When it comes to payments, we use trusted third-party platforms (like Stripe or PayPal) to process everything, so **the Site** doesn't store any of your payment info. Pretty neat, huh? Your subscription will **automatically renew** unless you cancel it before your current billing period ends.

**The 14-day refund policy** is pretty sweet: if you're a first-time subscriber and not totally stoked with our service, you can request a full refund within 14 days of purchase. Just hit us up at the contact email below and tell us what's up. Each user gets this one-time refund chance. Beyond that 14-day window, or for non-first-time subscribers, payments are **non-refundable** unless required by law.

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
Our content is our baby! 👶 All original content **is copyrighted by ai.hubtoday**, and you definitely can't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without our permission. **Users** only get a non-exclusive, non-transferable access right to check out our content for personal learning and reading. If you're looking to use it for business or need to quote extensively, just drop us a line to get authorization.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
Let's keep it civil, folks! **Users are strictly prohibited** from uploading, posting, or spreading any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights. And hey, **no tech wizardry**: don't even think about using technical means to bulk download, scrape, or crack our member content. If you're caught doing funny business, **the Site** has the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban rule-breaking users**. Play nice! 🚫

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
Just a heads-up: **we** totally reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate any part or all of our services at any time, without prior notice. If things go haywire due to stuff like force majeure, server issues, or third-party service interruptions causing content to be temporarily unavailable, **the Site** will **not be liable for any compensation**. That's just how it goes sometimes, ya know? 🤷‍♀️

## 7. Disclaimer
Our disclaimer is pretty straightforward: **the information provided by the Site** is purely for reference and **doesn't constitute** any professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical stuff). Also, for any direct or indirect losses you might experience from using our content or services, **the Site** is **not responsible**. Seriously, we're not on the hook for that.

## 8. Governing Law
**These Terms of Service** are governed by and interpreted according to the laws of California, USA, without regard to conflict of law principles. Got a dispute? Let's chat first and try to resolve it amicably. If we can't sort it out, then **you agree to submit** to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California. California dreamin' (of laws)! 🌴

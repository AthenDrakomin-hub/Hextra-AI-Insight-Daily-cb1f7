# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

**ai.hubtoday** (referred to as "this site" or "we") welcomes you! 👋 Before diving into our services, please give these Terms of Service a good read. By accessing or using this site, you're totally agreeing to and accepting these terms.

## 1. Service Overview
**This site** offers users paid subscription content and membership services. Think blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and cool community interactions, to name a few. Just a heads-up: some awesome content is exclusively for our subscribers!

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- **Users** need to provide a valid email address and create a password to set up an account.
- **Users** are totally on the hook for their account's security and all activities under it. Seriously, sharing or transferring your account is a big no-no! 🚫
- **This site** reserves the right to suspend or even terminate a user's account if they don't play by these rules.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- **Subscription services** are billed monthly or annually, with all fees clearly laid out on the checkout page.
- **All payments** zoom through secure third-party platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). And chill, this site absolutely *never* stores your payment info. 🔒
- **Subscriptions** will auto-renew, so make sure you cancel before your current billing cycle wraps up if you don't want to continue.
- **Our awesome 14-day refund policy** has your back! First-time subscribers, if you're not totally thrilled within 14 days of purchase, you can snag a full refund. Just shoot us an email via the contact info at the end of these terms and spill the beans on why you're bouncing. Each user gets one shot at this. After 14 days, or for non-first-time subscriptions, payments are generally non-refundable unless Uncle Sam says otherwise. 💸

## 4. Content Use & IP Rights
- **All original content** is copyrighted by this site (hubtoday). Seriously, no copying, reprinting, or commercial use without getting our say-so first! 🙅‍♂️
- **Users** only get a non-exclusive, non-transferable access pass for personal learning and reading. Keep it personal! 😉
- **For commercial use or if you're planning some hefty quoting**, please hit up this site to get the green light.

## 5. User Conduct Code
- **Users are strictly forbidden** from uploading, posting, or spreading any content that's illegal, harassing, fake, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights. Play nice!
- **Users are also expressly forbidden** from using tech tricks to bulk download, crawl, or crack into member content. No hacking! 🚫
- **This site** totally has the right to yank inappropriate content and kick violating users to the curb. Just sayin'.

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- **We** reserve the right to tweak, pause, or even pull the plug on part or all of our services anytime, without a heads-up. That's just how it rolls! 🤷‍♀️
- **This site** won't be on the hook for any compensation if content goes offline temporarily due to stuff like force majeure, server hiccups, or third-party service outages. Bummer, but true.

## 7. Disclaimer
- **The info provided by this site** is just for kicks and giggles (aka reference only!). It's absolutely *not* professional advice (like financial, legal, medical, or anything like that).
- **This site** isn't responsible for any direct or indirect oopsies users might run into from using our content or services. Fair warning!

## 8. Governing Law
- **These Terms of Service** are totally governed by and interpreted under the laws of the State of California, USA. We're talking no weird conflict of law principles here.
- **For any squabbles** bubbling up from or related to these terms, both parties should totally try to sort it out nicely first. If that doesn't fly, you agree to take it to the courts in Santa Clara County, California. Let the legal eagles do their thing! ⚖️

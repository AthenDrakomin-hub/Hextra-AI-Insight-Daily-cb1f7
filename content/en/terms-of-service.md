# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to herein as "this Site" or "We")! Before you dive into using our services, give these Terms of Service a good read. By accessing or using our Site, you're basically saying, "Yep, I'm cool with these terms." 🤙

## 1. Service Overview
Our Site hooks you up with paid subscription content and exclusive membership services. Think blog posts, special resources, e-books, and even community vibes! ✨ Just a heads-up, though: some of the cool stuff is only for our subscribed members.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
*   To create an account, **users** gotta provide a valid email address and set up a password. Easy peasy!
*   **Users** are fully responsible for keeping their account secure and for all the shenanigans happening on it. Oh, and transferring or sharing your account? That's a big no-no! 🚫
*   If **users** ever break these terms, **we** (the Site) totally reserve the right to hit the pause button or even pull the plug on their account. Just sayin'.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
*   **Subscription services** operate on a monthly or annual billing cycle, and don't sweat it—the exact fees will be crystal clear on the checkout page. 💰
*   For **all payments**, we use awesome third-party platforms like Stripe or PayPal. Just so you know, **we** never store your payment info ourselves. Your deets are safe!
*   Heads up: **subscriptions** will **auto-renew**! 🔄 Unless, of course, you cancel before your current billing period wraps up.
*   **Our 14-day Refund Policy** is pretty sweet! 💸 If you're a first-time subscriber and not totally stoked with our service within 14 days of buying, you can totally ask for a full refund. Just hit us up via the contact email at the end of these terms and tell us why you're bouncing. Each user gets this one-time refund chance. Beyond that 14-day window or if you're not a first-timer, sorry folks, unless the law literally makes us, **no refunds** after payment.

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
*   **All original content** here is totally **copyrighted by hubtoday (that's us!)**. So, no copying, reposting, or using it for commercial stuff without our permission, okay?
*   **Users** only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable pass** to access our content for their own personal learning and reading. Keep it personal!
*   **For commercial use or if you're thinking of quoting a lot**, please reach out to us (this Site) to get the green light. 👍

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
*   **It's a big no-no** to upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harasses anyone, is false, offensive, or steps on someone else's rights. Play nice! 🚫
*   **Also prohibited**: trying to bulk download, crawl, or hack into member content using any sneaky technical tricks. Seriously, don't.
*   **We** (this Site) totally have the right to yank any inappropriate content and **give rule-breaking users the boot**. 👋

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
*   **We** can totally change, hit pause on, or even end some or all of our services whenever we want, without giving you a heads-up. Just a fair warning!
*   If content becomes temporarily unavailable because of something crazy like an act of God, a server hiccup, or a third-party service outage, **this Site** is **not on the hook for any compensation**. Bummer, we know. 🤷‍♀️

## 7. Disclaimer
*   Just a heads-up: **the info we drop on this Site** is purely for reference. It's **not** meant to be any kind of professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical stuff), okay?
*   **This Site** is **totally not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses users might get hit with from using our content or services. Just keeping it real.

## 8. Governing Law
*   **These Terms of Service** are gonna be ruled by and interpreted according to California state law in the good ol' USA, without even thinking about those pesky conflict-of-law principles. So there! 🇺🇸
*   **Any squabbles** that pop up because of or related to these terms? We should totally try to sort them out amicably first. If that doesn't work, you're cool with bringing the case to the courts in Santa Clara County, California. Deal?

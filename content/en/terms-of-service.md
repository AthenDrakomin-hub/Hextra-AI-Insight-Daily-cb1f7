# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

**ai.hubtoday** welcomes you! We're super stoked to have you here (referred to herein as "the Site" or "we"). But first, before you dive into our awesome services, give these Terms of Service a quick read. By accessing or using our site, you're totally agreeing to and accepting these terms. Let's make it official, shall we? 😉

## 1. Service Introduction
**Our services**? Oh, they're packed with goodies! We're talking paid subscription content and exclusive membership services, like blog posts, special resources, e-books, and even community interaction. Heads up though, some of the really cool stuff is just for our awesome subscribers. Get ready to dive in! 🚀

## 2. User Registration and Account
- **To get your account set up**, you'll need to drop us a valid email and pick a strong password. Easy peasy!
- **Your account** is your responsibility! Keep it safe and secure, and remember, sharing or transferring it is a big no-no. It's just for you, pal.
- **We (the Site)** can totally hit pause or even shut down your account if you don't play by the rules. So, let's keep it smooth, okay?

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- **Our subscription services** are super flexible! You can choose monthly or annual billing, and we'll always show you the exact fees on the checkout page. No hidden surprises!
- **Payments** are handled safely and securely through awesome third-party platforms like Stripe or PayPal. Relax, we *never* store your payment deets on our site. Your info is safe!
- **Your subscription** is set to automatically renew, which is super convenient! But if you want to bail, just make sure to cancel before your current billing cycle ends. Easy peasy!
- **Need a refund?** We've got a cool **14-Day Refund Policy** for first-timers! If you're not totally thrilled with your initial subscription within 14 days of purchase, just hit us up via the email at the bottom of these terms and tell us why. Just a heads-up, this is a one-time thing per user. After 14 days, or if you're not a first-time subscriber, all sales are pretty much final, unless the law says otherwise. No worries!

## 4. Content Use and Intellectual Property
- **All our awesome original content** is totally copyrighted by **hubtoday**! So, please don't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial stuff without our say-so. Let's respect the creators! 🙏
- **As a user**, you get a super cool non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access our content for your personal learning and reading. Think of it as your personal VIP pass!
- **Big plans for our content?** If you're looking to use it commercially or quote large chunks, just drop us a line and we can chat about authorization. Let's make it happen the right way!

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- **User behavior** is super important around here! So, definitely *don't* upload, post, or spread anything illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or content that messes with other people's rights. Let's keep the vibes positive! ✨
- **Please, no tech tricks!** It's a big no-no to bulk download, scrape, or try to crack our member content using any technical wizardry. Play fair, peeps!
- **If rules are broken**, we'll have to step in. We totally reserve the right to remove any inappropriate content and even ban users who aren't playing by the rules. Let's keep our community awesome and safe!

## 6. Service Changes and Interruption
- **Our services** might evolve! We totally reserve the right to change, pause, or even stop parts or all of our services whenever we need to, without giving you a heads-up. It's all about making things better for everyone!
- **Heads up about downtime!** If stuff goes offline temporarily because of things like acts of God, server hiccups, or third-party service issues, we can't be held responsible for any compensation. Bummer, we know, but sometimes things are out of our control. 🤷‍♀️

## 7. Disclaimer
- **Quick disclaimer:** The info we share here is just for kicks and general knowledge. It's *not* professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical stuff), so please don't treat it as such! Always consult a pro for that. ✅
- **Regarding any losses**, we want to be clear: we're totally not responsible for any direct or indirect losses you might experience from using our content or services. Just keeping it real!

## 8. Governing Law
- **Our Governing Law** is pretty straightforward: these Terms of Service are all about the laws of the State of California, USA, and that's how we'll interpret them, no matter what other legal stuff might pop up. Just so you know!
- **Got a beef?** If any disputes come up concerning these terms, let's try to chat it out nicely first! Friendly negotiation is always our go-to. If that doesn't work, you're agreeing to take it to the courts in Santa Clara County, California. Let's hope it doesn't come to that! 🤞

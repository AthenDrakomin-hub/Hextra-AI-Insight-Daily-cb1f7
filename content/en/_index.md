### Frontier Research

1.  **GenArena** has introduced a new framework for visual generation evaluation, shaking things up! Traditional evaluation methods often miss the mark with human perception 🧠, but the [GenArena paper (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06013) offers a solution. By using a paired comparison paradigm instead of absolute scoring, open-source models actually outshine top closed-source ones! Evaluation accuracy jumps by **over 20%**, and its correlation with the LMArena leaderboard hits 0.86 💡, far surpassing conventional methods.

2.  **OmniMoE** is pushing the boundaries of expert granularity! The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture gets a [further evolution (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05711) with the introduction of vector-level atomic experts. Its Cartesian product router slashes routing complexity from O(N) to O(√N). With 1.7 billion active parameters, it achieves **50.9% zero-shot accuracy**, and inference latency drops from 73ms to a blazing 6.7ms ⚡—that's a 10.9x speedup! The code is already open source, too.

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact

1.  **Su Weijie** has received the prestigious COPSS Award, the highest honor in statistics—often called the "Nobel Prize of Statistics" ✨. A Chinese scholar has earned this recognition again after 14 years! Su Weijie, an associate professor at UPenn, was honored for his contributions to large model statistical foundations and privacy-preserving data analysis.
